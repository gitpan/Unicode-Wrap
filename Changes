		-n Unicode::Wrap -X -b 5.6.0

0.02  Sun Apr  6 15:15:04 CDT 2003
	- Better integration with Perl's built-in Unicode system
	- Now uses unicore/Lbrk.pl for property mappings
	- Text::Wrap-style interface replaces interface in 0.01
	- Explicit 'break_lines' function to do the meat of the work
       
0.03  Tue Apr  8 22:19:09 CDT 2003
	- Text::Wrap-style interface removed (belongs someplace like Text::Wrap)
	- New test cases should test nearly every LB rule defined in UAX#14
	- New property lookup code should be a little faster
	- Bug fixes
	- Completely different interface (sorry), should be easier to adapt to wider range of tasks
	- Added dependency on 5.8, since unicore isn't available in 5.6
